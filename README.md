<h1>Hi, I'm AndrÃ© Rosa! <br/> <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/andrÃ©-lrt-rosa">Computational Linguist | AI | NLP | Linguist | Translator | Proofreader | Cybersecurity</a></h1><br/>

As a highly dedicated individual always eager to embrace new challenges, I bring a diverse set of skills and a passion for continuous learning to the fields of Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, Applied Linguistics, Translation Studies and Cybersecurity.<br/><br/>
My journey began with a strong academic foundation, culminating in a PhD in Applied Linguistics with a specialization in Translation Studies from the Graduate Program in Linguistic Studies at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. This academic pursuit not only honed my analytical abilities but also fostered a deep appreciation for the intersection of technology and language, particularly in the realm of Natural Language Processing.<br/><br/>
Throughout my professional career, I've had the privilege of working in various capacities, including as an ESL teacher at private courses and academic institutions. My tenure as an English teacher for academic purposes further reinforced my commitment to effective communication and precision in language, qualities that are invaluable in the cybersecurity landscape.<br/><br/>
Driven by a desire for continuous improvement, I have expanded my skill set to encompass programming and development. Proficient in text editors, translation tools, and with intermediate proficiency in Python and Java programming languages, I am adept at leveraging technology to solve complex problems. Furthermore, my introductory knowledge in areas such as Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Javascript, HTML, and SQL, along with experience in writing in Latex, underscores my versatility in navigating diverse technological domains.<br/>
<br/>
Currently enrolled in the Foundations of Cybersecurity course by Google, I am actively cultivating my expertise in cybersecurity, recognizing its pivotal role in safeguarding digital assets and ensuring organizational resilience in an increasingly interconnected world.<br/>
My values center around integrity, accountability, and a commitment to excellence. I am deeply motivated by the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the security goals of organizations, protecting their assets and ensuring equitable access to digital resources.<br/>
In crafting this professional statement, my audience includes cybersecurity recruiters, organizations, and government employers who value individuals with a strong foundation in technology, coupled with a commitment to continuous learning and a genuine passion for cybersecurity.<br/>
<br/>
I am enthusiastic about the prospect of applying my strengths, values, and burgeoning cybersecurity expertise to support the security goals of diverse organizations, and I am eager to embark on this journey of professional growth and contribution.<br/>
